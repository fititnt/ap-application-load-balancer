# AP Application Load Balancer - v0.8.5-alpha
AP-ALB is not a single software, but **[Infrastructure As Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
via [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/) to automate creation and maintance of
with features common on expensive _Application Load Balancer_ of some cloud
providers** (e.g. [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/server-load-balancer),
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/),
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/load-balancer/),
[GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/),
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/load-balancer), etc). It can be used both to
create your own ALB on cheaper hardware on these same cloud providers or
have your own ALB on any other provider of VPSs or bare metal servers.

<!--

All stack is open source software, yet our main choices **HAproxy** and
**OpenResty/NGinx** are very likely to be the ones some big cloud providers use.

**There is no vendor lock in**, not even as option on AP-ALB we do not enforce
any specific cloud provider: but you should already have 1+ VPSs or bare metals
able to execute Ansible playbooks (Ubuntu Server 18.04+ are more tested).
The AP-ALB [license is Public Domain](#License) and is ok if you or your company
use this role to create your own custom versions.

-->

<!--

> TL;DR: you can use this and other works from Emerson Rocha or Etica.AI as
reference (from underline tools to full use of Infrastructure As Code). But
since we can't make promisses of full backward compatibility and we're testing
in very specific scenarios **we're not only OK that you can copy the Ansible Role
and make you custom version, but strongly recommended strategy**. The brand
"√Åguia Pescadora" / "AP" / "ap-" are not used on internal code, so this code
base is very useful to reuse parts betwen projects and even rebrand for
humanitarian or commercial projects from who help we on Etica.AI.

### ALB Goals

#### Automatic updates of components after deployed

The AP-ALB Infrastructure as Code written in Ansible can be labeled as `beta` or
`Release Candidate` but **the end result is aimed to be running non-stop in
production at least with security updates without human intervention**.

**Who guarantees updates:**
- **HAProxy 2.0**:
  - _Note: version **haproxy=2.0.\*** is locked_
  - <https://haproxy.debian.net/#?distribution=Ubuntu&release=bionic&version=2.0>
- **OpenrResty**: 
  - We use OpenResty¬Æ provides official pre-built packages
  - <https://openresty.org/en/linux-packages.html>
- **Automatic HTTPS**
  - GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl
    - We use OpenrResty package mananger
    - `luarocks install lua-resty-auto-ssl`
  - At moment we do not provide out of the box HTTPS using only HAProxy
    - Trust me. We do not found ways to automate Automatic HTTPS with HAProxy.
      to not require some level of human interation from time to time.
- **UFW**
  - Default from the system

If you manage make the initial setup with ALB works and just to be sure reboot
at least once, _is likely that if you forgot your server running it could be
working fine untill [Ubuntu Server EOLs](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)
(e.g. if Using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS could be 2023 or 2028)_.

#### Resilient to sysadmin errors on production servers

ALP do it's best to not stop services even when the administrator deploy invalid
configurations on production.

A human can be so self-confident (or not knowing the difference) and after
updating configurations on production instead of _reload a service_ go ahead and
_restart a service_. Sometimes is not only about packat loss (user or external
services receiving errors for a second) but with configuration errors will stop
an online service.

##### What about one-click rollback feature?

Note that we do not support [`one-click rollback` Ansistrano-like style](https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy)
... **yet**.

HAProxy & OpenResty is likely to resist errors, and have backup
files for every old configuration on the target servers, but if you use custom
configurations beyond what ALB is designed, you still will need to log on the
server and rename older files or re-run a playbook with ALB to allow fix it.

#### Decoupled subcomponents when makes sense
See [ALB components](#alb-components).

### ALB Non-Goals
> **non-goal** (plural non-goals)
> A potential goal or requirement which is explicitly excluded from the scope of a project.
> [wiktionary for non-goal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/non-goal)

#### Do not enforce specific Virtual Private Network implementation
One of the main goals of AP-ALB is be able to run on very cheap providers.
Another goal is work smooth with hosts across different providers. Both cases
when running AP-ALB in clustered mode could be done only with firewall, but tend
to be less complex just implement some underlining VPN across the nodes.

There are several ways to implement VPN, but as for AP-ALB, **our objective is
just make it work fine with private IPs and give at least one playbook example
with any VPN solution**. So its a Non-goal enforce (or even strong suggest) any
specific underlining VPN solution.

If your implemencation makes sense using VPNs, choose one underline
implementation that is aligned with your skillset and concerns with type of
survilance of the specific project you are working on to deploy AP-ALB.

#### Custom end user graphical interface or no need of sudo to deploy proxy rules
One of the big features of Load Balancers of big cloud providers is that they
have some way (like a web interface) for a user create their rules. Is possible
to make this for ALB, our target audience very likely is doing an ALB for
themselves and would have root access anyway on some cheap VPSs.

##### Potential alternatives

- **ALB + AWX Project (Ansible tower open source)**
  - AWX Project allows granular access when deploying changes with Ansible.
  - <https://github.com/ansible/awx>
  - <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/index.html>
- **ALB + Tsuru** (or any other PaaS)
  - Tsuru, years before Kubernetes was a thing, already allowed deploy apps
    similar to what Heroku does. You could only use the Auto HTTPS from ALB,
    use App rules for thinkgs that you really want control, and everyting else
    proxy to Tsuru.

## Quickstart Guide

### The minimum you already should know to use AP-ALB

> Note: this guide assumes that you at least
>
> 1. **Have Ansible installed on some computer**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
>     2. Tip: if is your first time with Ansible, this computer is likely to be
>        own computer and NOT the server where you want to install ALB
> 2. **Have at least one VPS or Bare metal VPS that can be controlled by your
>    installation Ansible**
> 3. **Have basic knowledge on how to use Ansible Playbooks**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Working With Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)
>     2. Hint: `ap-application-load-balancer` can be imported as a Ansible Role, but
>       it is not released on Ansible Galaxy (it means you can copy some version of
>       AP-ALB and place on sub-folder `roles/ap-application-load-balancer`)

### Complete examples using AP-ALB

- [example/playbook-complex.yml](example/playbook-complex.yml)
- <https://github.com/fititnt/ap-alb-demo>

### Quickstart on how to hotfix/debug production servers
See [debugging-quickstart.md](debugging-quickstart.md).

## ALB components

- **To permanently enable management by ALB for ALL components (default)**
  - `alb_manange_all: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB for ALL components**
  - `alb_manange_all: no`

---

**TL;DR on ALB Components**

- The most important components to run the [ALB Apps](#apps) are
[OpenResty](#openresty) <sup>(strong requeriment; installed by default)</sup> and
[HAProxy](#haproxy) <sup>(recommended suggestion, but optional; installed by default)</sup>.
  - Note that some ALB Components actually **are** designed to run fine even
    without [ALB Apps](#apps) / [OpenResty](#openresty) / [HAProxy](#haproxy).
    - Notable example is [UFW](#ufw) and bootstrap case would be a database server.
- The next important ALB Component is [UFW](#ufw)
<sup>(situational recommended suggestion; NOT enabled by default to mitigate
CharlieFoxtrots)</sup>. Consider enable when:
  - Your cloud provider (at least for the package you are paying) does not have
    better solution
    - Or if have, you do not want cloud vendor lock-in
  - You do not have better solutions using Ansible and are OK with the [UFW](#ufw)
    defaults.

For full details, check [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml). The main part
for a overview is:

```yaml
### AP-ALB Components overview _________________________________________________
# The defaults of v0.7.4+ will use: Apps, HAProxy, Logrotate, OpenResty
# You can enable/disable components. Or explicity enforce on your configuration
alb_manange_all: yes
alb_manange_haproxy: yes
alb_manange_openresty: yes
alb_manange_ufw: no

## Sanity Check run at very beginning
alb_manange_sanitycheck: yes

## Note: the next options is better leave it alone
alb_manange_apps: "{{ alb_manange_openresty }}"
alb_manange_logrotate: "{{ alb_manange_openresty or alb_manange_apps }}"

```

### Shared options

- :information_source: [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)
  - _"AP-ALB Components: shared options"_ section
- :information_source: [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml)
  - Some components may use variables that are not on defaults, like
    `alb_trusted_hosts: "{{ alb_dmz + alb_bastion_hosts }}"`.
    This may be the second place to review for security issues on your context.

**Shared options** are how we call variable conventions that could be used as
default option to improve more specific ALB Components or your own custom
implementation.

#### ACME

These options are re-used by components that manange Automatic Certificate
Management Environment (ACME). See [ACME on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment)
and [RFC 8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555).

```yaml
alb_acme_production: true
alb_acme_rule_whitelist: []
alb_acme_rule_whitelist_file: '' # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_blacklist: []      # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_blacklist_file: '' # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_last: true

# This value is infered from alb_acme_production. But you can customize yourself
alb_acme_url: "{{ 'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory' if alb_acme_production else 'https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory' }}"
```

#### Applications/Sysapplications variables

Variables prefixed with `app_` are used by [Apps](#apps) and [Sysapps](#sysapps)
and have some extra customization via [ALB Strategies](#alb-strategies).

These are key elements that form a single dictionary (think _object_) for the
`alb_apps` (list of dictionaries) and `alb_sysapps` (list of dictionaries).

**Quick example:**

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "static-files"
        app_domain: "assets.example.org"
        app_root: "/var/www/html"
        app_alb_strategy: "files-local"

      - app_uid: "minio"
        app_domain: "minio.example.org"
        app_alb_proxy: "http://localhost:9091"
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
```

##### app_*

> Note: as v0.8.x, this section still maybe not reflex all implementation, but
> as here as a plan of action (fititnt, 2019-12-04 17:27 BRT)

###### app_uid
- **Required**: _always_
- **Default**: _no default_
- **Type of Value**: `String`, `[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]`
  - Safe to use: _Letters (lower and UPPERCASE), Numbers, Underline, Hyphen_
  - Not safe so safe to use (but not blocked): _`:`, `;`, UTF-8 characters (requires you system to support)_
  - Definely not use: _blank spaces, `/`, `\`, control character (NUL \0, LF \n, ...)_
- **About uniqueness**:
  - **Should be unique per node** (but `alb_apps` and `alb_sysapps` can reuse same app_id)
  - **Is recommended to reuse 'app_id` on different nodes that are same
    application**
    - Example 1: Active-Active HA load balancing
    - Example 2: Active-Passive HA load balancing
  -  Note: Is not strongly required be unique per cluster of nodes, even if are very
     different applications or version of applications (think production vs
     staging)
- **Examples of Value**: `hello-world`, `hello_world`

Internaly, AP-ALB use `app_uid` common name for configutation files (like
`/opt/alb/apps/{{ app_uid }}.conf`), default logs directory, default data
diretory, internal aliases for which load balance and more.

###### app_state
- **Required**: _no (implicit value)_
- **Default**: "present"
- **Examples of Value**: `present`, `absent`

`app_state` defaults to `present`, so you did not need to define. If you want
remove one app, it's configurations rules, log files, etc, you should at least
once re-run one time with the same `app_uid` and `app_state: absent` for each
node. After this, you can remove referentes to the old app/sysapp.

Note: implementators **should not** automaticaly remove backups based only on
this configutation.

###### app_domain
- **Required**: _yes_
- **Default**: _Default value is user configurable, based on `app_uid`_
- **Type of Value**: `String`, `Regex String`
  - Check [NGinx/Server Names for advanced options](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html)
- **Examples of Value**: `hello-world.example.org`, `hello-world.*`, `"hello-world.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"`

Most `app_type` expect at least one main domain so the the AP-ALB will know what
to do when a request comes in.

###### app_domain_extras
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: _no default_
- **Type of Value**: list of `String`, `Regex String`
- **Examples of Value**:
> ```yaml
> # Empty list
> app_domain_extras: []
> # Please avoid using 'app_domain_extras: ' without defined itens and ': []' at the end
> ```
> ```yaml
> # List with 3 extra domains
> app_domain_extras:
>   - "hello-world.example.org"
>   - "hello-world.*"
>   - "hello-world.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
> ```
- **Advanced documentation**
  - Check [NGinx/Server Names for advanced options](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html)

Use this to add extra domains to [app_domain](#app_domain).

###### app_debug
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: `alb_forcedebug`<sup>(If defined)</sup>, `alb_default_app_forcedebug`<sup>(If defined)</sup>
- **Type of Value**: _Boolean_
- **Examples of Value**: `yes`, `true`, `no`, `false`

Mark one app in special to show more information, useful for debug. The
information depends on the [app_type](#app_type) implementation.

###### app_forcehttps
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: `false`, `alb_default_app_forcehttps`<sup>(If defined)</sup>
- **Type of Value**: _Boolean_
- **Examples of Value**: `yes`, `true`, `no`, `false`

If true, acessing HTTP port will redirect 301 to the `app_domain`.

This option is one alternative to not use Ansible Host vars or Ansible Group
Vars to define what Application run where. So you could have only one `alb_apps`
`alb_sysapps` for the entire cluster (or more than one cluster if using more
than one datacenter).

> @TODO: implement this feature (fititnt, 2019-12-04 22:43 BRT)

###### app_hook_after
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: _no default_
- **Type of Value**: _String_ (path to a single Ansible Tasks file to execute)
- **Examples of Value**: `{{ playbook_dir }}/hooks/app-static-html.yml`, `{{ role_path }}/ad-hoc-alb/hooks/debug.yml`, `{{ role_path }}/ad-hoc-alb/hooks/example/example_app_hook_after.yml`

You can execute custom tasks specific to one app after deployed.

###### app_hook_before
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: _no default_
- **Type of Value**: _String_ (path to a single Ansible Tasks file to execute)
- **Examples of Value**: `{{ playbook_dir }}/hooks/app-static-html.yml`, `{{ role_path }}/ad-hoc-alb/hooks/debug.yml`, `{{ role_path }}/ad-hoc-alb/hooks/example/example_app_hook_before.yml`


You can execute custom tasks specific to one app after deployed.

###### app_index
- **Required**: _no_
- **Default**: _no default_, `alb_default_app_index`<sup>(If defined)</sup>
- **Type of Value**: _String_ (name of files separed by spaces)
- **Examples of Value**: `index.html index.php`
- **Advanced documentation**
  - <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/serving-static-content/>

##### app_data_*

`app_data_*` are one way to document specific applications that you care about
make backups, or export/import from one node to another. The typical scenario
is you document, at App/Sysapp level, what a different AP-ALB node should have
to be fully operational.

As AP-ALB v0.8.2, this Role alone does not implement the full logistics of how
to make the import/export/backup but you are encoraged to use these variables
as one way to document or reuse future implementations.

Also keep in mind that even if AP-ALB implement these features, is likely that
you would still need configure external services to store backups, since the
priority here would be sincronize 2 nodes that, for example, do not have a
shared (and often sloooow) filesystem.

```

##### Deprecated app_* variables

###### app_raw_conf
Deprecated. Please use [app_raw_alb](#app_raw_alb) and/or
[app_alb_raw_file](#app_alb_raw_file)

###### No default value for app_alb_strategy
Before AP-ALB v.0.8.x alb_apps[n]app_alb_strategy has default value of
 `hello-word` (and before that,  `files-local`).

Now, value of app_alb_strategy is ommited, the alp_apps / alb_sysapps will be
ignored by OpenResty.

The reason for this is allow on future have apps that can exist only for other
reasons (for example, for NLB/HAProxy, or for Backup tasks). This also means
that a same app group could have variables reused for different strategies

#### Autentication Credentials

- :information_source: `password` fields are expected to have plaintext when
  executed via Ansible
  - **but you can use Ansible Valt to decrypt these passwords at run time**
    - <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html>
    - and then commit on your git repository
- :warning: `alb_auth_*` is meant to be used for **host level / system level**
  related autentication credentials.
  - :+1: good usage: HAProxy status page, Basic Auth for your internal systems
  - :-1: bad usage: ~default for end user autentication for their private pages~ (think `app_auth_*`)

```yaml

#### Bastion Hosts
- About Bastion Hosts: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host>
- :information_source: Both [Bastion Hosts](#bastion-hosts) and [Jump Server](#jump-server)
  (but NOT [DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)](#dmz-demilitarized-zone)), since some
  implementations could not even ask passwords) are good candidates for you add
  some host from outside, like a trusted server from the same client or other
  you own plus your own dinamic IP adress of your local machine.

```yaml
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 192.0.2.255
    name: "My Bastion Host"
```

#### DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)
- About DMZ: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)>
- :warning: **`alb_dmz` is expected to only have trusted IPs or IPs ranges** (think almost equivalent to localhost access)
  - ALB/UFW if enabled by default will allow all traffic FROM/TO these IPs.
  - ALB/HAproxy Stats page if enabled by default will consider this as trusted

```yaml

### Apps

> Tip: `apps` requires [OpenResty](#openresty).

- **To permanently enable management by ALB <sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_manange_apps: yes`
    - `alb_manange_openresty: yes` <sup>(Charlie Foxtrot when not enabled)</sup>
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_apps: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-apps --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-apps --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/Apps tasks**
  - `--tags alb-apps`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-apps`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/Apps tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-apps`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-apps`

For simplification each _group of rules_ is called "app" because most of the
time this is the case. The parameter `app_alb_strategy` defines wich [OpenResty
configuration template](templates/alb-strategy) will be used as base to
generate each file on `/opt/alb/apps/{{ app_uid }}.conf`.

> Protip: if you already have experience editing NGinx configurations, the way
AP-ALB automate the work for you will be very familiar.

#### ALB Strategies

**For full list of ALB Strategies, look at [templates/alb-strategy](templates/alb-strategy)**

##### files-local
Strategy to serve static files from the same server where the ALB is located.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "static-files"
        app_domain: "assets.example.org"
        app_root: "/var/www/html"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_strategy: "files-local"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2).

##### hello-world

Hello world is a simple strategy to test one App/Sysapp. It can be specially
useful to obtain SSL Certificates or already have some placeholder.

If `app_debug: true` or `alb_forcedebug: yes` it can be used to give more
information.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "hello-world"
        app_domain: "debug.example.org"
        app_domain_extras:
          - hello-world.example.com
          - hello-world.*
        app_debug: true
        app_alb_strategy: "hello-world"
```

See [templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2).

##### minimal

The `app_alb_strategy: minimal` is not as raw as the [raw](#raw), but is the
last step before what is given by [files-local](#files-local) or
[proxy](#proxy). Some applications could require so much fine tunning that is
just simpler to give access to you implement [app_alb_raw](#app_alb_raw) and/or
[app_alb_raw_file](#app_alb_raw_file), **BUT** all other configurations, like
paths to load balancer, logs, Automatic HTTPS, etc be handled for you.

```yaml
    alb_apps:
      - app_uid: "hello-world-minimal"
        app_domain: "hello-world-minimal.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_alb_strategy: "minimal"
        app_alb_raw_file: "templates/example_app_alb_raw_file.conf.j2"
        app_alb_raw: >
          charset_types application/json;
          default_type application/json;

          location = /status {
              stub_status;
              allow all;
          }
          location = /ping {
              access_log off;
              return 200 "pong\n";
          }
          location = / {
              content_by_lua_block {
                 local cjson = require "cjson"
                 ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_OK
                 ngx.say(cjson.encode({
                     msg = "Hello, hello-world-minimal! (from app_alb_raw)",
                     status = 200
                 }))
              }
          }
```

See [templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/minimal.conf.j2).

##### proxy
Use ALB as reverse proxy.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "minio"
        app_domain: "minio.example.org"
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_proxy: ":::9091"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2).

##### raw
`raw` strategy is similar to [minimal](#minimal), but you have full control
using [app_alb_raw](#app_alb_raw) and/or [app_alb_raw_file](#app_alb_raw_file).

This strategy can be specially useful on upgrades of AP-ALB where new
configurations could break some old functionality and you have no time to make
the new upgrades for some specific app.

### Bootstrap
- **To permanently enable management by ALB<sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_manange_bootstrap: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_bootstrap: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-bootstrap --check`
    - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-bootstrap --check`

<!--

This ALB group of tasks have 3 responsabilities:

1. If a node does not even have python installed, if you run with
  `gather_facts: no`, it will do a dirty raw checking and, if need, will install
  python for you. Then it will abort the play and ask you to allow
  `gather_facts` because of other modules will require.
2. (independent of `alb_manange_*` ) Based on your operational system
  boostrap mode will install some generic packages that you very likely would
  want
    - This step may make some checks, like if you by acident tried to run
      against one server that already is running some application on port :80
      or :443 and it was not created by AP-ALB. **Then it will abort the
      process**.
      - Think, for example, if running this agains one WHM server, ISPConfig,
        some Kubernetes cluster, etc. It will abort and require you add
        undocumented variables to force the boostraping continue
      - Think that one functionalities of AP-ALB is export or import
        applications from other hosting services
    - _TODO: add details later (fititnt, 2019-12-07 00:05 BRT)_
3. (based on `alb_manange_*: yes` and `alb_manange_*_repository: yes`) it
  based on what ALB components will be managed on other group of tasks, and
  if you operational system does not seems to have ideal repository to get
  the HAProxy/OpenResty, etc, it will add new repositories to your system.
4. (based on `alb_manange_*: yes`) if the ALB Components are enabled require
  the full directory structure (think folders for OpenResty/Apps/SysApps
  configurations and access logs) this step will create all directory structure
  of AP-ALB.
  - Note: this step may also do actions on server boostraped by older versions
    of AP-ALB.
5. Then, if it will mark you server as bootstraped. By default it will not try
  to do any of these tasks again at least until AP-ALB Role was upgraded.

-->

#### Bootstrap Python installation
- **Tested Operational Systems**:
  - CentOS 7, CentOS 8
  - Debian: 10 
  - FreeBSD 12
  - Ubuntu: 18.04

Ansible requires Python (better if is Python3) and for very new hosts, you may
get this error message: _"the module failed to execute correctly you probably
need to set the interpreter"_.

This means that you need to manually install python on your target hosts.
**BUT** you can use AP-ALB to use try [raw ‚Äì Executes a low-down and dirty
command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/raw_module.html)
and do it for you.

Check [example/bootstrap-even-python.yml](example/bootstrap-even-python.yml)
for more details. It's not necessary (and not recommended) leave
`alb_boostrap_python: "force"` saved on playbooks, since this part in special
of the ALB/Bootstrap have very limited safety checks if you missuse. You can
temporaly use via CLI extra commands, like this:

```bash
ansible-playbook my-playbook-with-gather_facts-false.yml -i example.org, -e='alb_boostrap_python=force'
```

Note, if even this fails, do it manually.

### HAProxy

- **To permanently enable management by ALB <sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_manange_haproxy: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_haproxy: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-haproxy --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-haproxy --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/HAProxy tasks**
  - `--tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-haproxy`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/HAProxy tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-haproxy`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-haproxy`

Please check [NLB Internals](nlb-internals.md) <sup>(working draft)</sup>.

#### HAProxy stats page

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_haproxy_stats_enabled: yes`
    - `alb_manange_haproxy: yes` <sup>(HAProxy Stats depends of HAProxy)</sup>
- **To permanently disable management by ALB <sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_haproxy_stats_enabled: no`


Please also check Check [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) section
`# AP-ALB Component: HAProxy | HAProxy Stats`.

Here a full example that will make you access HAProxy Status page from a host
example.com at <http://example.com:8404/haproxy?stats> from very specific IPs
and requiring user and passwords from `alb_auth_users`.

```yaml

> Security information: Even if you do not have [UFW](#ufw) enabled and forgot
to setup your own firewall (or use one from your cloud privider) the default
behavior of ALB stats page is still require the result of `alb_trusted_hosts_ips`
(this result is defined on [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml)).

#### HAProxy TLS Termination

At least for the ALB v0.6.1-alpha we do not provice automated way to implement
automatic HTTPS using only HAProxy. We implement using
[lua-resty-auto-ssl](#lua-resty-auto-ssl).

Still possible to do it but you will need to implement additional logic.

### Logrotate
Logrotate is enabled by default on [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) when
`alb_manange_openresty: yes` or `alb_manange_apps: yes`.

You can selectively disable with `alb_manange_logrotate: no`, but would be
recommended implement your own log strategy.

Check [tasks/logrotate/logrotate.yml](tasks/logrotate/logrotate.yml).

### OpenResty

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_openresty: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_openresty: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-openresty --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-openresty --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/OpenResty tasks**
  - `--tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-openresty`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/OpenResty tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-openresty`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-openresty`

Please check [ALB Internals](alb-internals.md).

#### Run OpenResty without HAProxy

> Strong suggestion: the memory footprint of using HAproxy in front of OpenResty
> is not a good reason to not leave enabled.

OpenResty, out of the box, have default values assuming [HAProxy](#haproxy)
is installed on the same host in front. If want to change this behavior,
consider change **at least** these variables from the defaults on
[defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
alb_manange_haproxy: no
alb_openresty_ip: 0.0.0.0
alb_openresty_httpport: 80
alb_openresty_httpsport: 443
```

#### lua-resty-auto-ssl

[GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl) used with
[OpenResty](#openresty) to allow Automatic
HTTPS on-the-fly.

See [Shared Option: ACME](#acme) to see rules that affect this implementation.

### SanityCheck
- **To permanently enable management by ALB (default)**
  - `alb_manange_sanitycheck: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_sanitycheck: no`

This ALB component (enabled by default) will run at very start of a play and
try to do some very basic sanity checks that have a tendency to cause a
node or a [entire cluster to enter on a non-operational state](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clusterfuck)
via human mistakes on ALB configurations.

### Status
> This **mode is safe run**, and can be used even in **Check Mode ("Dry Run")**
> with `--check` parameter. It's also expected (and you will be informed) that
> some checks will soft fail (like trying to check `alb_apps.facts`) on a node
> that does not have apps.

```bash
# Note: by default the standard status checks are always run at the end of a
#       successful. This may slow down your run, but we're consider a good
#       default.

#       BUT you may have a system so broken that not even the status checks
#       will start or you want call it directly

# This skips other steps and go diretly to minimal status checks
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml --check --tags="alb-status"

# TODO: implement a mode even more verbose:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml --check --tags="alb-status-full"
```


### Sysapps
> This feature still a draft (fititnt, 2019-12-02 14:25 BRT)

`Sysapps` implement near the same options than [Apps](#apps), but their focus
is namespace apps that are not intended for end user usage. The adantages
of this is apply default access control for all sysapps and also when running
very large deployment you could choose run only the Apps or the Sysapps rules.

```yaml

    # alb_sysapps_default not implemented yet
    alb_sysapps_default:
      app_forcehttps: no
      app_basicauth_file: "/opt/alb/sysapps/.htaccess"

    # If defined, will create /opt/alb/sysapps/.htaccess just once
    alb_sysapps_htpassword : "{{ alb_auth_users }}"

    alb_sysapps:
      - app_uid: "consul"
        app_domain: "consul.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_domain_extras:
          - consul.*
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_forcehttps: no
        app_alb_proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:8500"

      - app_uid: "haproxy"
        app_domain: "haproxy.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_domain_extras:
          - haproxy.*
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_alb_proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:{{ alb_haproxy_stats_port }}"
```

### UFW
> _To avoid acidental use, this feature is not enabled by default (and will
> **never** be on any future release). `alb_manange_ufw: yes` is explicitly
> required._

> _Protip: Check Mode ("Dry Run") with `--tags alb-ufw --check`. This will
 test changes **without** applying._

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_ufw: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB** <sup>(Default)</sup>
  - `alb_manange_ufw: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-ufw --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-ufw  --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/UFW tasks**
  - `--tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-ufw`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/UFW tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-ufw`

```yaml

# Allow ALB/UFW manage (required)
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)
# ALB/UFW will use alb_dmz to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
alb_dmz:
  - ip: 167.86.127.220
    name: apps_server_apalbdemo
  - ip: 167.86.127.225
    name: db_server_apalbdemo

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host
# ALB/UFW will use alb_bastion_hosts to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 177.126.157.169
    name: aguia-pescadora-delta.etica.ai

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server
# ALB/UFW will use alb_jump_boxes to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_jump_boxes:
  - ip: 192.0.2.10
    name: TEST-NET-1 (example IP)

```

#### Applying only firewall rules on a specific server (i.e. do not install HAProxy, OpenResty...)
Is possible to reuse the YAML syntax of AP-ALB to only configure firewall of a
server, without installing HAProxy, OpenResty, creating `/opt/alb/apps/` folders
etc.

This could be useful for database servers.

```yaml
# Works on ALB v0.6.1-alpha. Future versions may require other options disabled
alb_manange_haproxy: no
alb_manange_openresty: no
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# Use alb_ufw_rules, alb_dmz, alb_bastion_hosts, alb_jump_boxes etc
```

## Advanced usage

### Lua

Lua is fantastic language! Is actually easier to lean Lua and implement some
advanced rules than push Apache/Nginx configurations too much.

- Learn Lua in 15 Minutes (text): http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
- Learn Lua in an Hour (video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4eNl1rA1Ns
- Lua 5.1 short
reference: <http://lua-users.org/files/wiki_insecure/users/thomasl/luarefv51.pdf>
- Lua Online compiler: <https://repl.it/languages/lua>

Tip: you very likely will use Lua 5.1, because is the supported version of
LuaJIT (it means is faster and with more support).

### Risk mitigation
> _"Layered security, also known as layered defense, describes the practice of
combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data."
‚Äî [Layered security on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_security)_

<!--
This section applies in special if you is using ALB/UFW component (or any custom
solution based only on [IPTables firewall](http://ipset.netfilter.org/)) as a
layer of defence **inside** your servers not meant to be exposed to the public
internet instead of private networking.
-->

AP-ALB, as one Infrastructure as Code way to implement a single or a clustered
servers to work as Application Load Balancers, is designed to work with
_aceptable risks_ without rely on some features that are not available on
**very cheap VPSs without enterprise features** (like private networking,
extra disks, snapshots) and **still relatively sysadmin (user) friendly** for
what it is really doing. By extension, this also means it will work with mixed
setups (e.g. some VPSs could be on expensive AWS, while others on other cloud
providers, like Azure, or cheaper but very good ones, like Contabo).

<!--
This [Risk mitigation](#risk-mitigation) topic contain some informations that
either could improve your setup if is getting more complex or 
-->

#### Still use passwords for intra-cluster communications (We're looking at you, Redis, MongoDB...)
**TL;DR: if a software support autentication with AP-ALB you SHOULD implement
this layer of defence even if and 80% of guides on internet teach how to use
without.** This is not a strong requeriment if you is using AP-ALB inside
the same region of cloud provider with support for private networking or you
implement IPSec/OpenVPN, but even on this cases still better already have your
services ready to expand and avoid human error with future misconfigurations.

Some softwares in special (like Redis and MongoDB) tend to have friendly guides
that will work securely (securely as _"from outside attacks, not from errors
inside your network"_) without need of authentication. There are so many things
that can go wrong that the overhead of performance the need of authentication
and extra steps on your scripts are not plausible excuses.

Even if the AP-ALB does not manange your service on another VPS, you may
eventually want to use HAProxy to load balance a service that is not on
localhost, but on that VPS. And the easyers ways to do this _are likely to
go [charlie-foxtrot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clusterfuck)_.

#### Should you use private networkig from my cloud provider? Should you implement IPSec/OpenVPN?
**TL;DR: not required, but is a good idea if you can.**

If some of your hosts are on a cloud provider that you already have option to
have extra firewalls or private networking inside the VPSs on that region, yes
that's a good idea. You already paid, use it.

About implement IPSec/OpenVPN or equivalent to do Software-Defined Networking,
it's up to you, but since it can be not trivial to implement, we try to not
depent on this implementation. As `ALB v0.8.0-alpha` we do not have Components
to automate creation of private network, but you could still use the
[Shared options](#shared-options) or do the initial setup without Ansible
automation.

#### Prefer guides that assume security requirements for geo-distributed applications
**TL;DR: This last topic on Risk mitigation is for where you can find relevant information.**

**Do not assume same level of security of private networking and same
datacenter**: the averange guide on internet (in special the ones from cloud
providers) will assume both cases and sometimes they are so resilient on this
feature that will suggest no autentication at all for intra-cluster
communication even when the underlines softwares allow and strongly encourage
it's use.

One generic protip here is, when in doubt with guides, check the same guides
but with _"geo-distributed applications/replication"_ or _"multicloud"_. Even
if you do not implement IPSec or OpenVPN, the averagen guide on how to configure
the applications will very likely to still rely on autentication for the apps
that need to talk with each other.

## FAQ

- _Which version of AP-ALB should you use?_
  - **Choose at [ap-application-load-balancer/releases](https://github.com/fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer/releases)**.
    You can use the master branch, but we recommend review new updates.
    ALB is meant to be used non-stop on production servers, so you can stick
    with some version or maintain your own private changes.
- _How much overhead of RAM and CPU a server with AP-ALB have compared with
  alternative NameOfAlternative?_
  - **The overhead of HAProxy and OpenResty is low. Trust me.**
- _AP-ALB is mean to be installed just only _on frontend servers_ that are exposed to
  public IPs and then access internal servers?_
  - **This use is just one of the cases**  (and the most intuitive compared to
    cloud ALBs)
  - **BUT you can also have, as example, both**
    - **all-in-one (BothApplication/Network Load Balancer and some
       PHP/Python/Java/Etc servers) on a single machine or**
    - **put AP-ALB servers behind AP-ALB servers.**
- _If AP-ALB could be installed "on everyting" it means even on database servers?_
  - **If you are both your application server and database server are on same
    host, yes**
  - **But if you have to choose betwen put a network load balancer (the HAProxy)
      or on the database(s) server(s) or on the application server(s) (the
      ones running PHP/Python/NodeJS/Java/Etc) put on you application servers.**
