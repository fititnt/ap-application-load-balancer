# √Åguia Pescadora Application Load Balancer (_"AP-ALB"_) - v0.6.2-alpha
AP-ALP is not a single software, but **[Infrastructure As Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
via [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/) to automate creation and maintance of
with features common on expensive _Application Load Balancer_ of some cloud
providers** (e.g. [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/server-load-balancer),
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/),
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/load-balancer/),
[GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/),
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/load-balancer), etc). It can be used both to
create your own ALB on cheaper hardware on these same cloud providers or
have your own ALB on any other provider of VPSs or bare metal servers.

All stack is open source software, yet our main choices **HAproxy** and
**OpenResty/NGinx** are very likely to be the ones some big cloud providers use.

**There is no vendor lock in**, not even as option on AP-ALB we do not enforce
any specific cloud provider: but you should already have 1+ VPSs or bare metals
able to execute Ansible playbooks (Ubuntu Server 18.04+ are more tested).
The AP-ALB [license is Public Domain](#License) and is ok if you or your company
use this role to create your own custom versions.

<!--

> TL;DR: you can use this and other works from Emerson Rocha or Etica.AI as
reference (from underline tools to full use of Infrastructure As Code). But
since we can't make promisses of full backward compatibility and we're testing
in very specific scenarios **we're not only OK that you can copy the Ansible Role
and make you custom version, but strongly recommended strategy**. The brand
"√Åguia Pescadora" / "AP" / "ap-" are not used on internal code, so this code
base is very useful to reuse parts betwen projects and even rebrand for
humanitarian or commercial projects from who help we on Etica.AI.

### ALB Goals

<!--
#### Stability over

-->

#### Relatively decoupled subcomponents
At [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml), you have

```yaml
### Enable/Disable ALB subcomponents ___________________________________________
## Note: these defaults will install everyting, except the firewall.
alb_manange_all: yes
alb_manange_haproxy: yes
alb_manange_openresty: yes
alb_manange_ufw: no

## Optionated (but NOT required) group of tasks.
alb_manange_common: yes  # hostname, timezone (UTC) [See tasks/common/common.yml]
alb_manange_devtools: no # net-tools, htop, hatop [tasks/devtools/devtools.yml]

## Note: the next options is better leave it alone
alb_manange_apps: "{{ alb_manange_openresty }}"
alb_manange_logrotate: "{{ alb_manange_haproxy or alb_manange_openresty }}"
```

> @TODO short explanation on how to reuse only parts of the subcomponents (fititnt, 2019-11-11 00:13 BRT)

#### Don't stop services even when the administrator deploy invalid requests

> @TODO short explanation on how alert errors (fititnt, 2019-11-11 00:13 BRT)

## Quickstart Guide

### The minimum you already should know to use AP-ALB

> Note: this guide assumes that you at least
>
> 1. **Have Ansible installed on some computer**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
>     2. Tip: if is your first time with Ansible, this computer is likely to be
>        own computer and NOT the server where you want to install ALB
> 2. **Have at least one VPS or Bare metal VPS that can be controlled by your
>    installation Ansible**
> 3. **Have basic knowledge on how to use Ansible Playbooks**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Working With Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)
>     2. Hint: `ap-application-load-balancer` can be imported as a Ansible Role, but
>       it is not released on Ansible Galaxy (it means you can copy some version of
>       AP-ALB and place on sub-folder `roles/ap-application-load-balancer`)

### Apps

#### ALB Strategies
For simplification each _group of rules_ is called "app" because most of the
time this is the case. The parameter `app_alb_strategy` defines wich [OpenResty
configuration template](templates/alb-strategy) will be used as base to
generate each file on `/opt/alb/apps/{{ app_uid }}.conf`.

> Protip: if you already have experience editing NGinx configurations, the way
AP-ALB automate the work for you will be very familiar.

**For full list of ALB Strategies, look at [templates/alb-strategy](templates/alb-strategy)**

##### hello-world

The `hello-world` replaced [files-local](#files-local) strategy as default if
you do not specify a `app_alb_strategy`. It can be specially useful to obtain
SSL Certificates or already have some placeholder.

If `app_debug: true` or `alb_forcedebug: yes` it can be used to give more
information faster.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "hello-world"
        app_domain: "debug.example.org"
        app_debug: true
        app_alb_strategy: "hello-world"
```

See [templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2).

##### files-local
Strategy to serve static files from the same server where the ALB is located.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "static-files"
        app_domain: "assets.example.org"
        app_root: "/var/www/html"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_strategy: "files-local"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2).

##### proxy
Use ALB as reverse proxy.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "minio"
        app_domain: "minio.example.org"
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_proxy: ":::9091"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2).

##### raw
Use a raw string to create an OpenResty configuration file.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "myrawconfiguration"
        app_alb_strategy: "raw"
        app_raw_conf: |
          #
          # Th content of app_raw_conf variable will be saved on the file
          # /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/sites-enabled/myrawconfiguration.conf
          #

```

See [templates/alb-strategy/raw.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/raw.conf.j2).

##### socket-php
> This strategy is a draft and/or can be removed or made obsolet by [proxy](#proxy).

See [templates/alb-strategy/socket-php.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/socket-php.conf.j2).

### OpenResty

> _@TODO add quick guide on OpenResty features here (fititnt, 2019-11-11 02:01 BRT_

Please check [ALB Internals](alb-internals.md).

#### lua-resty-auto-ssl

> _@TODO add quick guide on lua-resty-auto-ssl here (fititnt, 2019-11-11 02:06 BRT_

See [GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl).

### HAProxy

> _@TODO add quick guide on HAProxy features here (fititnt, 2019-11-11 02:01 BRT_

Please check [NLB Internals](nlb-internals.md) <sup>(working draft)</sup>.

#### HAProxy stats page

> _@TODO add quick guide on HAProxy stats page here (fititnt, 2019-11-11 02:01 BRT_

#### HAProxy TLS Termination

At least for the ALB v0.6.1-alpha we do not provice automated way to implement
automatic HTTPS using only HAProxy. We implement using
[lua-resty-auto-ssl](#lua-resty-auto-ssl).

Still possible to do it but you will need to implement additional logic.

### Firewall
> _To avoid acidental use, this feature is not enabled by default.
> `alb_manange_ufw: yes` is explicitly required._

> _Protip: Check Mode ("Dry Run") with `--tags alb-ufw --check`. This will 
 test changes **without** applying._

See also [Firewall Internals](firewall-internals.md) <sup>(working draft)</sup>.

```yaml

# Allow ALB/UFW manage (required)
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)
# ALB/UFW will use alb_dmz to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
alb_dmz:
  - ip: 167.86.127.220
    name: apps_server_apalbdemo
  - ip: 167.86.127.225
    name: db_server_apalbdemo

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host
# ALB/UFW will use alb_bastion_hosts to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 177.126.157.169
    name: aguia-pescadora-delta.etica.ai

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server
# ALB/UFW will use alb_jump_boxes to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_jump_boxes:
  - ip: 192.0.2.10
    name: TEST-NET-1 (example IP)

```

#### Applying only firewall rules on a specific server (i.e. do not install HAProxy, OpenResty...)
Is possible to reuse the YAML syntax of AP-ALB to only configure firewall of a
server, without installing HAProxy, OpenResty, creating `/opt/alb/apps/` folders
etc.

This could be useful for database servers.

```yaml
# Works on ALB v0.6.1-alpha. Future versions may require other options disabled
alb_manange_haproxy: no
alb_manange_openresty: no
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# Use alb_ufw_rules, alb_dmz, alb_bastion_hosts, alb_jump_boxes etc
```

## FAQ

- _Which version of AP-ALB should you use?_
  - **Choose at [ap-application-load-balancer/releases](https://github.com/fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer/releases)**.
    You can use the master branch, but we recommend review new updates.
    ALB is meant to be used non-stop on production servers, so you can stick
    with some version or maintain your own private changes.
- _How much overhead of RAM and CPU a server with AP-ALB have compared with
  alternative NameOfAlternative?_
  - **The overhead of HAProxy and OpenResty is low. Trust me.**
- _AP-ALB is mean to be installed just only _on frontend servers_ that are exposed to
  public IPs and then access internal servers?_
  - **This use is just one of the cases**  (and the most intuitive compared to
    cloud ALBs)
  - **BUT you can also have, as example, both**
    - **all-in-one (BothApplication/Network Load Balancer and some
       PHP/Python/Java/Etc servers) on a single machine or**
    - **put AP-ALB servers behind AP-ALB servers.**
- _If AP-ALB could be installed "on everyting" it means even on database servers?_
  - **If you are both your application server and database server are on same
    host, yes**
  - **But if you have to choose betwen put a network load balancer (the HAProxy)
      or on the database(s) server(s) or on the application server(s) (the
      ones running PHP/Python/NodeJS/Java/Etc) put on you application servers.**
