# AP Application Load Balancer - v0.8.5-alpha

[![GitHub: fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer](docs/img/badges/github.svg)](https://github.com/fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer) [![Website: ap-application-load-balancer.etica.ai](docs/img/badges/website.svg)](https://ap-application-load-balancer.etica.ai/)

AP-ALB is not a single software, but **[Infrastructure As Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
via [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/) to automate creation and maintance of
with features common on expensive _Application Load Balancer_ of some cloud
providers** (e.g. [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/server-load-balancer),
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/),
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/load-balancer/),
[GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/),
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/load-balancer), etc). It can be used both to
create your own ALB on cheaper hardware on these same cloud providers or
have your own ALB on any other provider of VPSs or bare metal servers. And yes,
it handle automatic HTTPS for you on-the-fly **even** for clusters of ALBs, like
enterprise versions of Traefik or Caddyserver.

**AP-ALB is flexible**: you can either use dedicated very small VPSs with the role
of load balancing to another services or replace your Apache/NGinx/HAproxy in
each server with AP-ALB. Consider around just 64MB of RAM per node as baseline.
_(So, if you are deployng in a dedicated 1GB VPS, consider **at least** reuse
the same node puting behind the AP-ALB one Varnish-Cache!)_

**New on v0.8:** in addition to the single-node setup, you can now deploy 3-node
High Available AP-ALB Cluster using [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) instead of
local filesystem. We recommend using the Ansible Role
[brianshumate.consul](https://github.com/brianshumate/ansible-consul) for setup
and manangement of Consul component. Examples can be found at
[fititnt/ansible-linux-ha-cluster](https://github.com/fititnt/ansible-linux-ha-cluster).

<!--

All stack is open source software, yet our main choices **HAproxy** and
**OpenResty/NGinx** are very likely to be the ones some big cloud providers use.

**There is no vendor lock in**, not even as option on AP-ALB we do not enforce
any specific cloud provider: but you should already have 1+ VPSs or bare metals
able to execute Ansible playbooks (Ubuntu Server 18.04+ are more tested).
The AP-ALB [license is Public Domain](#License) and is ok if you or your company
use this role to create your own custom versions.

-->

<!--

> TL;DR: you can use this and other works from Emerson Rocha or Etica.AI as
reference (from underline tools to full use of Infrastructure As Code). But
since we can't make promisses of full backward compatibility and we're testing
in very specific scenarios **we're not only OK that you can copy the Ansible Role
and make you custom version, but strongly recommended strategy**. The brand
"√Åguia Pescadora" / "AP" / "ap-" are not used on internal code, so this code
base is very useful to reuse parts betwen projects and even rebrand for
humanitarian or commercial projects from who help we on Etica.AI.

### AP-ALB Non-Goals

Content moved to [docs/goals/index.md](docs/goals/index.md).

## Quickstart Guide

### The minimum you already should know to use AP-ALB

> Note: this guide assumes that you at least
>
> 1. **Have Ansible installed on some computer**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
>     2. Tip: if is your first time with Ansible, this computer is likely to be
>        own computer and NOT the server where you want to install ALB
> 2. **Have at least one VPS or Bare metal VPS that can be controlled by your
>    installation Ansible**
> 3. **Have basic knowledge on how to use Ansible Playbooks**
>     1. [https://docs.ansible.com: Working With Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)
>     2. Hint: `ap-application-load-balancer` can be imported as a Ansible Role, but
>       it is not released on Ansible Galaxy (it means you can copy some version of
>       AP-ALB and place on sub-folder `roles/ap-application-load-balancer`)

### Complete examples using AP-ALB
- [example/playbook-basic.yml](example/playbook-basic.yml)
- [example/playbook-complex.yml](example/playbook-complex.yml)
- <https://github.com/fititnt/ap-alb-demo>

### Quickstart on how to hotfix/debug production servers
See [debugging-quickstart.md](debugging-quickstart.md).

## ALB components

- **To permanently enable management by ALB for ALL components (default)**
  - `alb_manange_all: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB for ALL components**
  - `alb_manange_all: no`

---

**TL;DR on ALB Components**

- The most important components to run the [ALB Apps](#apps) are
[OpenResty](#openresty) <sup>(strong requeriment; installed by default)</sup> and
[HAProxy](#haproxy) <sup>(recommended suggestion, but optional; installed by default)</sup>.
  - Note that some ALB Components actually **are** designed to run fine even
    without [ALB Apps](#apps) / [OpenResty](#openresty) / [HAProxy](#haproxy).
    - Notable example is [UFW](#ufw) and bootstrap case would be a database server.
- The next important ALB Component is [UFW](#ufw)
<sup>(situational recommended suggestion; NOT enabled by default to mitigate
CharlieFoxtrots)</sup>. Consider enable when:
  - Your cloud provider (at least for the package you are paying) does not have
    better solution
    - Or if have, you do not want cloud vendor lock-in
  - You do not have better solutions using Ansible and are OK with the [UFW](#ufw)
    defaults.

For full details, check [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml). The main part
for a overview is:

```yaml
### AP-ALB Components overview _________________________________________________
# The defaults of v0.7.4+ will use: Apps, HAProxy, Logrotate, OpenResty
# You can enable/disable components. Or explicity enforce on your configuration
alb_manange_all: yes
alb_manange_haproxy: yes
alb_manange_openresty: yes
alb_manange_ufw: no

## Sanity Check run at very beginning
alb_manange_sanitycheck: yes

## Note: the next options is better leave it alone
alb_manange_apps: "{{ alb_manange_openresty }}"
alb_manange_logrotate: "{{ alb_manange_openresty or alb_manange_apps }}"

```

---

### Shared options

- :information_source: [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)
  - _"AP-ALB Components: shared options"_ section
- :information_source: [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml)
  - Some components may use variables that are not on defaults, like
    `alb_trusted_hosts: "{{ alb_dmz + alb_bastion_hosts }}"`.
    This may be the second place to review for security issues on your context.

**Shared options** are how we call variable conventions that could be used as
default option to improve more specific ALB Components or your own custom
implementation.

#### ACME

These options are re-used by components that manange Automatic Certificate
Management Environment (ACME). See [ACME on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment)
and [RFC 8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555).

```yaml
alb_acme_production: true
alb_acme_rule_whitelist: []
alb_acme_rule_whitelist_file: '' # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_blacklist: []      # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_blacklist_file: '' # not implemented... yet
alb_acme_rule_last: true

# This value is infered from alb_acme_production. But you can customize yourself
alb_acme_url: "{{ 'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory' if alb_acme_production else 'https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory' }}"
```
#### Applications/Sysapplications variables

Content moved to [docs/rules/index.md](docs/rules/index.md).

#### Autentication Credentials

- :information_source: `password` fields are expected to have plaintext when
  executed via Ansible
  - **but you can use Ansible Valt to decrypt these passwords at run time**
    - <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html>
    - and then commit on your git repository
- :warning: `alb_auth_*` is meant to be used for **host level / system level**
  related autentication credentials.
  - :+1: good usage: HAProxy status page, Basic Auth for your internal systems
  - :-1: bad usage: ~default for end user autentication for their private pages~ (think `app_auth_*`)

```yaml
alb_auth_users:
  - username: Admin1
    password: "plain-password"
  - username: Admin2
    password: "plain-password2"
  - username: "old-user-that-should-be-removed"
    password: "anotheranotherpass"
    state: absent
  - username: SuperUser2
    password: !vault |

```

#### Bastion Hosts
- About Bastion Hosts: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host>
- :information_source: Both [Bastion Hosts](#bastion-hosts) and [Jump Server](#jump-server)
  (but NOT [DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)](#dmz-demilitarized-zone)), since some
  implementations could not even ask passwords) are good candidates for you add
  some host from outside, like a trusted server from the same client or other
  you own plus your own dinamic IP adress of your local machine.

```yaml
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 192.0.2.255
    name: "My Bastion Host"
```

#### DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)
- About DMZ: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)>
- :warning: **`alb_dmz` is expected to only have trusted IPs or IPs ranges** (think almost equivalent to localhost access)
  - ALB/UFW if enabled by default will allow all traffic FROM/TO these IPs.
  - ALB/HAproxy Stats page if enabled by default will consider this as trusted

```yaml
alb_dmz:
 - ip: 203.0.113.1
   name: my_apps_server
 - ip: 203.0.113.2
   name: my_db_server
 - ip: 203.0.113.3
   name: any_other_server_inside_the_network
```

#### Jump Server
- About Jump Server: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server>
- :information_source: Both [Bastion Hosts](#bastion-hosts) and [Jump Server](#jump-server)
(but NOT [DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)](#dmz-demilitarized-zone), since some
implementations could not even ask passwords) are good candidates for you add
some host from outside, like a trusted server from the same client or other
you own plus your own dinamic IP adress of your local machine.

```yaml
alb_jump_boxes:
  - ip: 192.0.2.10
    name: "my jumpbox server"
```

### Apps

> Tip: `apps` requires [OpenResty](#openresty).

- **To permanently enable management by ALB <sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_manange_apps: yes`
    - `alb_manange_openresty: yes` <sup>(Charlie Foxtrot when not enabled)</sup>
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_apps: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-apps --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-apps --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/Apps tasks**
  - `--tags alb-apps`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-apps`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/Apps tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-apps`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-apps`

For simplification each _group of rules_ is called "app" because most of the
time this is the case. The parameter `app_alb_strategy` defines wich [OpenResty
configuration template](templates/alb-strategy) will be used as base to
generate each file on `/opt/alb/apps/{{ app_uid }}.conf`.

> Protip: if you already have experience editing NGinx configurations, the way
AP-ALB automate the work for you will be very familiar.

#### ALB Strategies

**For full list of ALB Strategies, look at [templates/alb-strategy](templates/alb-strategy)**

##### files-local
Strategy to serve static files from the same server where the ALB is located.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "static-files"
        app_domain: "assets.example.org"
        app_root: "/var/www/html"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_strategy: "files-local"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/files-local.conf.j2).

##### hello-world

Hello world is a simple strategy to test one App/Sysapp. It can be specially
useful to obtain SSL Certificates or already have some placeholder.

If `app_debug: true` or `alb_forcedebug: yes` it can be used to give more
information.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "hello-world"
        app_domain: "debug.example.org"
        app_domain_extras:
          - hello-world.example.com
          - hello-world.*
        app_debug: true
        app_alb_strategy: "hello-world"
```

See [templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2).

##### minimal

The `app_alb_strategy: minimal` is not as raw as the [raw](#raw), but is the
last step before what is given by [files-local](#files-local) or
[proxy](#proxy). Some applications could require so much fine tunning that is
just simpler to give access to you implement [app_alb_raw](#app_alb_raw) and/or
[app_alb_raw_file](#app_alb_raw_file), **BUT** all other configurations, like
paths to load balancer, logs, Automatic HTTPS, etc be handled for you.

```yaml
    alb_apps:
      - app_uid: "hello-world-minimal"
        app_domain: "hello-world-minimal.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_alb_strategy: "minimal"
        app_alb_raw_file: "templates/example_app_alb_raw_file.conf.j2"
        app_alb_raw: >
          charset_types application/json;
          default_type application/json;

          location = /status {
              stub_status;
              allow all;
          }
          location = /ping {
              access_log off;
              return 200 "pong\n";
          }
          location = / {
              content_by_lua_block {
                 local cjson = require "cjson"
                 ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_OK
                 ngx.say(cjson.encode({
                     msg = "Hello, hello-world-minimal! (from app_alb_raw)",
                     status = 200
                 }))
              }
          }
```

See [templates/alb-strategy/hello-world.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/minimal.conf.j2).

##### proxy
Use ALB as reverse proxy.

```yaml
    alb_apps:

      - app_uid: "minio"
        app_domain: "minio.example.org"
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_forcehttps: yes
        app_alb_proxy: ":::9091"
```
See [templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2](templates/alb-strategy/proxy.conf.j2).

##### raw
`raw` strategy is similar to [minimal](#minimal), but you have full control
using [app_alb_raw](#app_alb_raw) and/or [app_alb_raw_file](#app_alb_raw_file).

This strategy can be specially useful on upgrades of AP-ALB where new
configurations could break some old functionality and you have no time to make
the new upgrades for some specific app.

### Bootstrap
- **To permanently enable management by ALB<sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_manange_bootstrap: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_bootstrap: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-bootstrap --check`
    - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-bootstrap --check`

<!--

This ALB group of tasks have 3 responsabilities:

1. If a node does not even have python installed, if you run with
  `gather_facts: no`, it will do a dirty raw checking and, if need, will install
  python for you. Then it will abort the play and ask you to allow
  `gather_facts` because of other modules will require.
2. (independent of `alb_manange_*` ) Based on your operational system
  boostrap mode will install some generic packages that you very likely would
  want
    - This step may make some checks, like if you by acident tried to run
      against one server that already is running some application on port :80
      or :443 and it was not created by AP-ALB. **Then it will abort the
      process**.
      - Think, for example, if running this agains one WHM server, ISPConfig,
        some Kubernetes cluster, etc. It will abort and require you add
        undocumented variables to force the boostraping continue
      - Think that one functionalities of AP-ALB is export or import
        applications from other hosting services
    - _TODO: add details later (fititnt, 2019-12-07 00:05 BRT)_
3. (based on `alb_manange_*: yes` and `alb_manange_*_repository: yes`) it
  based on what ALB components will be managed on other group of tasks, and
  if you operational system does not seems to have ideal repository to get
  the HAProxy/OpenResty, etc, it will add new repositories to your system.
4. (based on `alb_manange_*: yes`) if the ALB Components are enabled require
  the full directory structure (think folders for OpenResty/Apps/SysApps
  configurations and access logs) this step will create all directory structure
  of AP-ALB.
  - Note: this step may also do actions on server boostraped by older versions
    of AP-ALB.
5. Then, if it will mark you server as bootstraped. By default it will not try
  to do any of these tasks again at least until AP-ALB Role was upgraded.

-->

#### Bootstrap Python installation
- **Tested Operational Systems**:
  - CentOS 7, CentOS 8
  - Debian: 10
  - FreeBSD 12
  - Ubuntu: 18.04

Ansible requires Python (better if is Python3) and for very new hosts, you may
get this error message: _"the module failed to execute correctly you probably
need to set the interpreter"_.

This means that you need to manually install python on your target hosts.
**BUT** you can use AP-ALB to use try [raw ‚Äì Executes a low-down and dirty
command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/raw_module.html)
and do it for you.

Check [example/bootstrap-even-python.yml](example/bootstrap-even-python.yml)
for more details. It's not necessary (and not recommended) leave
`alb_boostrap_python: "force"` saved on playbooks, since this part in special
of the ALB/Bootstrap have very limited safety checks if you missuse. You can
temporaly use via CLI extra commands, like this:

```bash
ansible-playbook my-playbook-with-gather_facts-false.yml -i example.org, -e='alb_boostrap_python=force'
```

Note, if even this fails, do it manually.

  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-haproxy`

Please check [NLB Internals](nlb-internals.md) <sup>(working draft)</sup>.

#### HAProxy stats page

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_haproxy_stats_enabled: yes`
    - `alb_manange_haproxy: yes` <sup>(HAProxy Stats depends of HAProxy)</sup>
- **To permanently disable management by ALB <sup>(default)</sup>**
  - `alb_haproxy_stats_enabled: no`


Please also check Check [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) section
`# AP-ALB Component: HAProxy | HAProxy Stats`.

Here a full example that will make you access HAProxy Status page from a host
example.com at <http://example.com:8404/haproxy?stats> from very specific IPs
and requiring user and passwords from `alb_auth_users`.

```yaml
alb_manange_haproxy: yes

alb_haproxy_stats_enabled: yes
alb_haproxy_stats_ip: 0.0.0.0 # 0.0.0.0 means exposed for everyone. Use firewall!
alb_haproxy_stats_port: 8404
alb_haproxy_stats_uri: "/haproxy?stats"
alb_haproxy_stats_realm: "{{ alb_name }}: {{ inventory_hostname }}"

# If informed, HAProxy Stats page will allow access from alb_trusted_hosts_ips:
# (localhost + alb_dmz + alb_bastion_hosts) [Does not include alb_jump_boxes]
alb_dmz:
  - ip: 167.86.127.220
    name: apps_server_apalbdemo
  - ip: 167.86.127.225
    name: db_server_apalbdemo
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 177.126.157.169
    name: aguia-pescadora-delta.etica.ai

# If informed, HAProxy Stats page will require require user and password from alb_auth_users
alb_auth_users:
  - username: Admin1
    password: "plain-password"
  - username: Admin2
    password: "plain-password2"
  - username: SuperUser2
    password: !vault |
      $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
      62313365396662343061393464336163383764373764613633653634306231386433626436623361

      6564


# As ALB 0.7.4, without further customizations, if both alb_trusted_hosts_ips
# and alb_auth_users are provided, even from these IPs you is required to
# provide a password
```

> Security information: Even if you do not have [UFW](#ufw) enabled and forgot
to setup your own firewall (or use one from your cloud privider) the default
behavior of ALB stats page is still require the result of `alb_trusted_hosts_ips`
(this result is defined on [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml)).

#### HAProxy TLS Termination

At least for the ALB v0.6.1-alpha we do not provice automated way to implement
automatic HTTPS using only HAProxy. We implement using
[lua-resty-auto-ssl](#lua-resty-auto-ssl).

Still possible to do it but you will need to implement additional logic.

### Logrotate
Logrotate is enabled by default on [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) when
`alb_manange_openresty: yes` or `alb_manange_apps: yes`.

You can selectively disable with `alb_manange_logrotate: no`, but would be
recommended implement your own log strategy.

Check [tasks/logrotate/logrotate.yml](tasks/logrotate/logrotate.yml).

### OpenResty

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_openresty: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_openresty: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-openresty --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-openresty --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/OpenResty tasks**
  - `--tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-openresty`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/OpenResty tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-openresty`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-openresty`

Please check [ALB Internals](alb-internals.md).

#### Run OpenResty without HAProxy

> Strong suggestion: the memory footprint of using HAproxy in front of OpenResty
> is not a good reason to not leave enabled.

OpenResty, out of the box, have default values assuming [HAProxy](#haproxy)
is installed on the same host in front. If want to change this behavior,
consider change **at least** these variables from the defaults on
[defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
alb_manange_haproxy: no
alb_openresty_ip: 0.0.0.0
alb_openresty_httpport: 80
alb_openresty_httpsport: 443
```

#### lua-resty-auto-ssl

[GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl) used with
[OpenResty](#openresty) to allow Automatic
HTTPS on-the-fly.

See [Shared Option: ACME](#acme) to see rules that affect this implementation.

### SanityCheck
- **To permanently enable management by ALB (default)**
  - `alb_manange_sanitycheck: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_sanitycheck: no`

This ALB component (enabled by default) will run at very start of a play and
try to do some very basic sanity checks that have a tendency to cause a
node or a [entire cluster to enter on a non-operational state](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clusterfuck)
via human mistakes on ALB configurations.

### Status
> This **mode is safe run**, and can be used even in **Check Mode ("Dry Run")**
> with `--check` parameter. It's also expected (and you will be informed) that
> some checks will soft fail (like trying to check `alb_apps.facts`) on a node
> that does not have apps.

```bash
# Note: by default the standard status checks are always run at the end of a
#       successful. This may slow down your run, but we're consider a good
#       default.

#       BUT you may have a system so broken that not even the status checks
#       will start or you want call it directly

# This skips other steps and go diretly to minimal status checks
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml --check --tags="alb-status"

# TODO: implement a mode even more verbose:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml --check --tags="alb-status-full"
```


### Sysapps
> This feature still a draft (fititnt, 2019-12-02 14:25 BRT)

`Sysapps` implement near the same options than [Apps](#apps), but their focus
is namespace apps that are not intended for end user usage. The adantages
of this is apply default access control for all sysapps and also when running
very large deployment you could choose run only the Apps or the Sysapps rules.

```yaml

    # alb_sysapps_default not implemented yet
    alb_sysapps_default:
      app_forcehttps: no
      app_basicauth_file: "/opt/alb/sysapps/.htaccess"

    # If defined, will create /opt/alb/sysapps/.htaccess just once
    alb_sysapps_htpassword : "{{ alb_auth_users }}"

    alb_sysapps:
      - app_uid: "consul"
        app_domain: "consul.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_domain_extras:
          - consul.*
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_forcehttps: no
        app_alb_proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:8500"

      - app_uid: "haproxy"
        app_domain: "haproxy.{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}.nip.io"
        app_domain_extras:
          - haproxy.*
        app_alb_strategy: "proxy"
        app_alb_proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:{{ alb_haproxy_stats_port }}"
```

### UFW
> _To avoid acidental use, this feature is not enabled by default (and will
> **never** be on any future release). `alb_manange_ufw: yes` is explicitly
> required._

> _Protip: Check Mode ("Dry Run") with `--tags alb-ufw --check`. This will
 test changes **without** applying._

- **To permanently enable management by ALB**
  - `alb_manange_ufw: yes`
- **To permanently disable management by ALB** <sup>(Default)</sup>
  - `alb_manange_ufw: no`
- **Check Mode ("Dry Run"): only test changes without applying**
  - `--tags alb-ufw --check`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-ufw  --check`
- **To temporarily only execute ALB/UFW tasks**
  - `--tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --tags alb-ufw`
- **To temporarily only skips ALB/UFW tasks**
  - `--skip-tags alb-ufw`
  - Example: `ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --skip-tags alb-ufw`

```yaml

# Allow ALB/UFW manage (required)
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)
# ALB/UFW will use alb_dmz to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
alb_dmz:
  - ip: 167.86.127.220
    name: apps_server_apalbdemo
  - ip: 167.86.127.225
    name: db_server_apalbdemo

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host
# ALB/UFW will use alb_bastion_hosts to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_bastion_hosts:
  - ip: 177.126.157.169
    name: aguia-pescadora-delta.etica.ai

# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server
# ALB/UFW will use alb_jump_boxes to make all traffic FROM/TO to this machine free
# This behavior could change on future to make it more configurable
alb_jump_boxes:
  - ip: 192.0.2.10
    name: TEST-NET-1 (example IP)

```

#### Applying only firewall rules on a specific server (i.e. do not install HAProxy, OpenResty...)
Is possible to reuse the YAML syntax of AP-ALB to only configure firewall of a
server, without installing HAProxy, OpenResty, creating `/opt/alb/apps/` folders
etc.

This could be useful for database servers.

```yaml
# Works on ALB v0.6.1-alpha. Future versions may require other options disabled
alb_manange_haproxy: no
alb_manange_openresty: no
alb_manange_ufw: yes

# Use alb_ufw_rules, alb_dmz, alb_bastion_hosts, alb_jump_boxes etc
```

## Advanced usage

### Lua

Lua is fantastic language! Is actually easier to lean Lua and implement some
advanced rules than push Apache/Nginx configurations too much.

- Learn Lua in 15 Minutes (text): http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
- Learn Lua in an Hour (video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4eNl1rA1Ns
- Lua 5.1 short
reference: <http://lua-users.org/files/wiki_insecure/users/thomasl/luarefv51.pdf>
- Lua Online compiler: <https://repl.it/languages/lua>

Tip: you very likely will use Lua 5.1, because is the supported version of
LuaJIT (it means is faster and with more support).

### Risk mitigation
> _"Layered security, also known as layered defense, describes the practice of
combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data."
‚Äî [Layered security on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_security)_

<!--
This section applies in special if you is using ALB/UFW component (or any custom
solution based only on [IPTables firewall](http://ipset.netfilter.org/)) as a
layer of defence **inside** your servers not meant to be exposed to the public
internet instead of private networking.
-->

AP-ALB, as one Infrastructure as Code way to implement a single or a clustered
servers to work as Application Load Balancers, is designed to work with
_aceptable risks_ without rely on some features that are not available on
**very cheap VPSs without enterprise features** (like private networking,
extra disks, snapshots) and **still relatively sysadmin (user) friendly** for
what it is really doing. By extension, this also means it will work with mixed
setups (e.g. some VPSs could be on expensive AWS, while others on other cloud
providers, like Azure, or cheaper but very good ones, like Contabo).

<!--
This [Risk mitigation](#risk-mitigation) topic contain some informations that
either could improve your setup if is getting more complex or
-->

#### Still use passwords for intra-cluster communications (We're looking at you, Redis, MongoDB...)
**TL;DR: if a software support autentication with AP-ALB you SHOULD implement
this layer of defence even if and 80% of guides on internet teach how to use
without.** This is not a strong requeriment if you is using AP-ALB inside
the same region of cloud provider with support for private networking or you
implement IPSec/OpenVPN, but even on this cases still better already have your
services ready to expand and avoid human error with future misconfigurations.

Some softwares in special (like Redis and MongoDB) tend to have friendly guides
that will work securely (securely as _"from outside attacks, not from errors
inside your network"_) without need of authentication. There are so many things
that can go wrong that the overhead of performance the need of authentication
and extra steps on your scripts are not plausible excuses.

Even if the AP-ALB does not manange your service on another VPS, you may
eventually want to use HAProxy to load balance a service that is not on
localhost, but on that VPS. And the easyers ways to do this _are likely to
go [charlie-foxtrot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clusterfuck)_.

#### Should you use private networkig from my cloud provider? Should you implement IPSec/OpenVPN?
**TL;DR: not required, but is a good idea if you can.**

If some of your hosts are on a cloud provider that you already have option to
have extra firewalls or private networking inside the VPSs on that region, yes
that's a good idea. You already paid, use it.

About implement IPSec/OpenVPN or equivalent to do Software-Defined Networking,
it's up to you, but since it can be not trivial to implement, we try to not
depent on this implementation. As `ALB v0.8.0-alpha` we do not have Components
to automate creation of private network, but you could still use the
[Shared options](#shared-options) or do the initial setup without Ansible
automation.

#### Prefer guides that assume security requirements for geo-distributed applications
**TL;DR: This last topic on Risk mitigation is for where you can find relevant information.**

**Do not assume same level of security of private networking and same
datacenter**: the averange guide on internet (in special the ones from cloud
providers) will assume both cases and sometimes they are so resilient on this
feature that will suggest no autentication at all for intra-cluster
communication even when the underlines softwares allow and strongly encourage
it's use.

One generic protip here is, when in doubt with guides, check the same guides
but with _"geo-distributed applications/replication"_ or _"multicloud"_. Even
if you do not implement IPSec or OpenVPN, the averagen guide on how to configure
the applications will very likely to still rely on autentication for the apps
that need to talk with each other.

## FAQ

- _Which version of AP-ALB should you use?_
  - **Choose at [ap-application-load-balancer/releases](https://github.com/fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer/releases)**.
    You can use the master branch, but we recommend review new updates.
    ALB is meant to be used non-stop on production servers, so you can stick
    with some version or maintain your own private changes.
- _How much overhead of RAM and CPU a server with AP-ALB have compared with
  alternative NameOfAlternative?_
  - **The overhead of HAProxy and OpenResty is low. Trust me.**
- _AP-ALB is mean to be installed just only _on frontend servers_ that are exposed to
  public IPs and then access internal servers?_
  - **This use is just one of the cases**  (and the most intuitive compared to
    cloud ALBs)
  - **BUT you can also have, as example, both**
    - **all-in-one (BothApplication/Network Load Balancer and some
       PHP/Python/Java/Etc servers) on a single machine or**
    - **put AP-ALB servers behind AP-ALB servers.**
- _If AP-ALB could be installed "on everyting" it means even on database servers?_
  - **If you are both your application server and database server are on same
    host, yes**
  - **But if you have to choose betwen put a network load balancer (the HAProxy)
      or on the database(s) server(s) or on the application server(s) (the
      ones running PHP/Python/NodeJS/Java/Etc) put on you application servers.**
